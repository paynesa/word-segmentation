# word-segmentation

1000 word types
60,000 word tokens 
Frequencies of words were Zipfian distribution: max = approx 8000, min =  10) 
Word lengths generated by drawing from Poisson distribution with mean 2 and adding 1 to avoid lengths of 0 
Length and frequency of individual words were chosen independently 
words = 24 consonants and 14 vowels into 336 CV syllables and concatenating randomly 
sentences = randomly concatenating words according to the frequency distribution of word types with no word 
repeated immediately after itself, as in original work  
Sentence lengths (in words) were generated by drawing from a Poisson
with mean 2 and adding 2 to avoid sentences of length 1; the mean
sentence length was 4 words (hence, 12 syllables).
